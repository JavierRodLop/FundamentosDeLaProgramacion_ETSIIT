# Welcome to my class notes and works
## Of the first semester coding subject

Here I'll be uploading and committing my daily work (yeah, I want those squares to be green). For now I'll upload to this repository some basic C++ programs and as the career progresses I'll include not only my classes' work and notes, but also the code for future personal projects I have in mind. ;)
